## Breathe Circles

CSS animation breathing exercise. Circles expand and contract as a counter counts the cycles. Animation is six ten-second cycles; a one-minute total breathing exercise.

## Reflection

My goal was to build something that utilized fairly simple CSS animation and had a practical purpose. An animated breathing exercise worked. The animation itself was not too difficult. One of the main challenges was how to represent "breathing" with animated objects. I experimented with a number of techniques from using bars on a chart, to inflating balloons, to objects that changed color to simulate an increase or decrease in oxygen. The other challenge was coloring: what best represents "air" and "breathe" but also has some visual excitement.
